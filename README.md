ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Miquel!

A bit about me:
- I develop mobile apps, mainly using React Native. Although apps are my main interest, I am also looking out for new oportunities to learn on other fields.
- On my free time I play piano (as a beginer), guitar or sing. I aslo love hiking and or any type of sports that involve nature.
